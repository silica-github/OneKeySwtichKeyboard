# OneKeySwtichKeyboard

Referencing the implementation of *[Android Keyboard Switcher](https://github.com/Kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher)** , create a one-click method to bring up the input method switch options. This makes it convenient to switch input methods using gesture tools like Xposed Edge without occupying the notification area.
